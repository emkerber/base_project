Authored by Liz Kerber

June 25, 2016: index.html, app.js, and stylesheet.css are created and pushed to a remote repository. The file index.html has basic functionality, and is linked to app.js and stylesheet.css. The file app.js includes only the author and date created. The file stylesheet.css has no content. This README is also created at this time.
